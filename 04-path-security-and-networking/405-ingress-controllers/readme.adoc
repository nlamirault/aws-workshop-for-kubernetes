= Add Ingress Controllers to Kubernetes cluster
:toc:

:imagesdir: ../../resources/images

This chapter explains how to apply both Nginx and AWS ALB Ingress Controllers to a Kubernetes cluster.
These controllers allow you to set rules that control the routing of external traffic to the services in your Kubernetes cluster.
The role of the Ingress controller is to watch the Kubernetes API server for ingress events, and to action those events.
For example, creating an Ingress resource is an event. The Ingress controller will act on the event by creating the
appropriate Ingress resource; in the case of this example, this could be an Nginx or an AWS ALB resource.

Kubernetes Ingress has two parts:

 * Ingress resource: the Ingress definition, defined in a YAML file
 * Ingress controller: deployed on the Kubernetes master, the controller implements the Ingress in your cluster.

There is no default Ingress controller provided in Kubernetes. It may be provided by your platform, or you must install one.
Since an Ingress controller is not provided on AWS by default, we will install one.

== Prerequisites
In order to perform exercises in this chapter, youâ€™ll need to deploy configurations to a Kubernetes cluster. To create an EKS-based Kubernetes cluster, use the link:../../01-path-basics/102-your-first-cluster#create-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-eks[AWS CLI] (recommended). If you wish to create a Kubernetes cluster without EKS, you can instead use link:../../01-path-basics/102-your-first-cluster#alternative-create-a-kubernetes-cluster-with-kops[kops].

== Nginx Ingress Controller

Perform the following steps to install an Nginx ingress controller for your Kubernetes cluster. It will be exposed using the AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

First, apply the initial setup commands:

	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/namespace.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/default-backend.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/configmap.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/tcp-services-configmap.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/udp-services-configmap.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

RBAC roles, or Role Based Access Control, are methods for controlling access to resources based on roles and permissions of individual users. RBAC must be enabled on the api server with the flag, `--authorization-mode=RBAC`. A `Role` can be used to restrict access to a single namespace. Alternatively, a `ClusterRole` can apply access permissions to a particular namespace or across all namespaces. In addition, `RoleBinding` binds the permissions granted by a role to a single user or set of users. `ClusterRoleBinding` can grant these permissions cluster wide and across all namespaces.

To configure the Nginx Ingress Controller without RBAC roles use the following command:

	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/without-rbac.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

To configure with RBAC:

	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/rbac.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/with-rbac.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

The AWS ELB allows you to apply both L4 and L7 network protocols for ingress behind `Type=LoadBalancer`. Layer 4 uses TCP as the listener protocol for ports 80 and 443. Layer 7 uses HTTP for port 80 and terminates TLS at the ELB.

To configure Layer 4:

	kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/service-l4.yaml
	kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/patch-configmap-l4.yaml

To configure Layer 7:

	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/service-l7.yaml > service-l7.yaml

Edit the the line of the file service-l7.yaml to replace the dummy id with a valid one in the form "arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:XXXXXXXX:certificate/XXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX"

	kubectl apply -f service-l7.yaml
	kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/aws/patch-configmap-l7.yaml

If RBAC is enabled, apply the following:

	kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/patch-service-with-rbac.yaml

If not, apply this command:

	kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/master/deploy/provider/patch-service-without-rbac.yaml

== ALB Ingress Controller

CoreOS has developed an Ingress controller that uses AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to Kubernetes services.
We'll deploy this Ingress controller and use it to route traffic to our Pods.

=== IAM role

You should already have an IAM role assigned to your Kubernetes worker nodes. The role ARN will be similar to
`arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/nodes.cluster.k8s.local`. Check the role in the IAM Console and make sure it
contains the following for the nodes.cluster.k8s.local inline policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "elasticloadbalancing:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        .
        .
```


=== Editing config

Before starting the exercise there are some small edits to make.

 * Edit `templates/alb-ingress-resource.yaml` and change the list of subnets to match your own: alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/subnets
 * Edit `templates/alb-ingress-controller.yaml` and change the AWS_REGION and CLUSTER_NAME to match your own. There
 is no need to enter an access key.

=== Ingress controller

As mentioned earlier, deploying an Ingress resource has no effect unless there is an Ingress controller that implements
 the resource. This involves two steps:

 * deploying the `default-http-backend` resource that all Ingress controllers depend upon
 * deploying the Ingress controller itself

First, deploy the `default-http-backend` resource:

    $ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/alb-ingress-controller/master/examples/default-backend.yaml

Then deploy the Ingress controller:

    $ kubectl create -f templates/alb-ingress-controller.yaml

=== Sample application

We'll deploy a sample application that we'll expose via an Ingress. We will use the same greeter application as used
in the microservices section, with one small change: we'll expose the webapp service using a NodePort instead of a LoadBalancer.
The difference is that NodePort maps the container port to a port on the node hosting the container. The same port
will be used on each node. LoadBalancer, on the other hand, will create an AWS ELB that balances traffic across the
pods running on the worker nodes. In this example, we'll use an Ingress to create an ALB to balance traffic across the
pods running on the worker nodes.

. Deploy the application:

  $ kubectl create -f templates/app.yml

. Get the list of services:

  $ kubectl get svc
    NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    greeter-service   ClusterIP   100.71.100.49    <none>        8080/TCP       57m
    kubernetes        ClusterIP   100.64.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        27d
    name-service      ClusterIP   100.71.205.66    <none>        8080/TCP       57m
    webapp-service    NodePort    100.70.135.114   <none>        80:32202/TCP   57m

=== Ingress resource

Deploy the Ingress resource. This will create an AWS ALB and route traffic to the pods in the service using ALB
target groups:

    $ kubectl create -f templates/alb-ingress-resource.yaml

It will take a couple of minutes to create the ALB associated with your Ingress. Check the status as follows:

    $ kubectl describe ing webapp-alb-ingress

```
Name:             webapp-alb-ingress
Namespace:        default
Address:          clusterk8sl-default-webapp-9895-1236164836.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
Default backend:  default-http-backend:80 (100.96.7.26:8080)
Rules:
  Host  Path  Backends
  ----  ----  --------
  *
        /   webapp-service:80 (<none>)
Annotations:
Events:
  Type    Reason  Age               From                Message
  ----    ------  ----              ----                -------
  Normal  CREATE  32m               ingress-controller  clusterk8sl-default-webapp-9895 created
  Normal  CREATE  32m               ingress-controller  clusterk8sl-32202-HTTP-5a4bb0d target group created
  Normal  CREATE  32m               ingress-controller  80 listener created
  Normal  CREATE  32m               ingress-controller  1 rule created
  Normal  CREATE  3m (x3 over 32m)  ingress-controller  Ingress default/webapp-alb-ingress
  Normal  UPDATE  3m (x6 over 32m)  ingress-controller  Ingress default/webapp-alb-ingress
```

This shows your Ingress is listening on port 80. Now check the status of your service:

    $ kubectl get svc webapp-service
```
NAME             TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
webapp-service   NodePort   100.70.135.114   <none>        80:32202/TCP   1h
```

This shows your service is listening on port 32202 (your port may differ). I expect an ALB to be created with a listener
on port 80, and a target group routing traffic to port 32202 on each of my nodes. Port 32202 is the NodePort that maps
to my container port.

Use the EC2 Console to check the status of your ALB. Check the Target Groups and see if they are routing traffic to
port 32202 (this should be evident in the Description and Targets tab, i.e. the health checks should also route to
this port). Check the Load Balancer listener - it should be listening on port 80.

Once the ALB has a status of 'active' in the EC2 Console, you can curl your Ingress endpoint using the Address
of the Ingress resource:

    $ curl clusterk8sl-default-webapp-9895-1236164836.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    Hello Arunc

=== Cleanup

    $ kubectl delete -f templates/alb-ingress-resource.yaml
    $ kubectl delete -f templates/app.yml
    $ kubectl delete -f templates/alb-ingress-controller.yaml
    $ kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/alb-ingress-controller/master/examples/default-backend.yaml

Check in the EC2 console to ensure your ALB has been deleted.

== Kube AWS Ingress Controller and Skipper

link:https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kubernetes-on-aws[Kube AWS Ingress Controller]
creates AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) that is used to terminate TLS connections and use
link:https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/[AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)] or
link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)]
certificates. ALBs are used to route traffic to an Ingress http router for example
link:https://github.com/zalando/skipper/[skipper], which routes
traffic to Kubernetes services and implements
link:https://zalando.github.io/skipper/dataclients/kubernetes/[advanced features]
like green-blue deployments, feature toggles, reate limits, circuitbreakers, shadow traffic or A/B tests.

In short the major differences from CoreOS ALB Ingress Controller is:

- it uses Cloudformation instead of API calls
- does not have routes limitations from AWS
- automatically finds the best matching ACM and IAM certifacte for your ingress
- you are free to use an http router imlementation of your choice, which can implement more features like green-blue deployments

For this tutorial I assume you have GNU sed installed, if not read
commands with `sed` to modify the files according to the `sed` command
being run. If you are running BSD or MacOS you can use `gsed`.

We need to have cloud labels enabled for this ingress controller to work.
You have 2 options, skip the section which does not fit in your case:

1. <<Create a New Cluster>>
2. <<Modify an Existing Cluster>>

=== Create a New Cluster

Cloud Labels are required to make Kube AWS Ingress Controller work,
because it has to find the AWS Application Load Balancers it manages
by AWS Tags, which are called cloud Labels in kops.

If not already set, you have to set some environment variables to choose AZs to deploy to,
your S3 Bucket name for kops configuration and you kops cluster name:


        export AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES=eu-central-1b,eu-central-1c
        export S3_BUCKET=kops-aws-workshop-<your-name>
        export KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME=example.cluster.k8s.local


Then you create the kops cluster and validate that everything is set up properly.

        export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://${S3_BUCKET}
        kops create cluster --name $KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES --cloud-labels kubernetes.io/cluster/$KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME=owned --yes
        kops validate cluster

=== Modify an Existing Cluster

To modify your existing kops cluster and update it.

        export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://${S3_BUCKET}
        kops edit cluster $KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME

Add cloudLabels dependent on your $KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME, for example example.cluster.k8s.local:

```
 spec:
   cloudLabels:
     kubernetes.io/cluster/example.cluster.k8s.local: owned
```

Update the cluster with the new configuration:

       kops update cluster $KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME --yes


=== IAM role

This is the effective policy that you need for your EC2 nodes for the
kube-aws-ingress-controller, which we will use:

```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "acm:ListCertificates",
    "acm:DescribeCertificate",
    "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups",
    "autoscaling:AttachLoadBalancers",
    "autoscaling:DetachLoadBalancers",
    "autoscaling:DetachLoadBalancerTargetGroups",
    "autoscaling:AttachLoadBalancerTargetGroups",
    "autoscaling:DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups",
    "cloudformation:*",
    "elasticloadbalancing:*",
    "elasticloadbalancingv2:*",
    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
    "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
    "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
    "ec2:DescribeRouteTables",
    "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
    "iam:GetServerCertificate",
    "iam:ListServerCertificates"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "*"
  ]
}
```

To apply the mentioned policy you have to add link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/iam_roles.md[additionalPolicies with kops] for your cluster, so edit your cluster.

        kops edit cluster $KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME

and add this to your node policy:

```
  additionalPolicies:
    node: |
      [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "acm:ListCertificates",
            "acm:DescribeCertificate",
            "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups",
            "autoscaling:AttachLoadBalancers",
            "autoscaling:DetachLoadBalancers",
            "autoscaling:DetachLoadBalancerTargetGroups",
            "autoscaling:AttachLoadBalancerTargetGroups",
            "autoscaling:DescribeLoadBalancerTargetGroups",
            "cloudformation:*",
            "elasticloadbalancing:*",
            "elasticloadbalancingv2:*",
            "ec2:DescribeInstances",
            "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
            "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
            "ec2:DescribeRouteTables",
            "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
            "iam:GetServerCertificate",
            "iam:ListServerCertificates"
          ],
          "Resource": ["*"]
        }
      ]
```

After that make sure this was applied to your cluster with:


        kops update cluster $KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME --yes
        kops rolling-update cluster


=== Security Group for Ingress

To be able to route traffic from ALB to your nodes you need to create
an Amazon EC2 security group with Kubernetes tags, that allow ingress
port 80 and 443 from the internet and everything from ALBs to your
nodes. Tags are used from Kubernetes components to find AWS components
owned by the cluster. We will do with the AWS cli:

        aws ec2 create-security-group --description ingress.$KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME --group-name ingress.$KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME
        aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-names ingress.$KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME
        sgidingress=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=group-name,Values=ingress.$KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME | jq '.["SecurityGroups"][0]["GroupId"]' -r)
        sgidnode=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=group-name,Values=nodes.$KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME | jq '.["SecurityGroups"][0]["GroupId"]' -r)
        aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id $sgidingress --protocol tcp --port 443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
        aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id $sgidingress --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

        aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id $sgidnode --protocol all --port -1 --source-group $sgidingress
        aws ec2 create-tags --resources $sgidingress--tags "kubernetes.io/cluster/id=owned" "kubernetes:application=kube-ingress-aws-controller"

=== AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

To have TLS termination you can use AWS managed certificates.  If you
are unsure if you have at least one certificate provisioned use the
following command to list ACM certificates:

        aws acm list-certificates

If you have one, you can move on to the next section.

To create an ACM certificate, you have to requset a CSR with a domain name that you own in link:https://aws.amazon.com/route53/[route53], for example.org. We will here request one wildcard certificate for example.org:

        aws acm request-certificate --domain-name *.example.org

You will have to successfully do a challenge to show ownership of the
given domain. In most cases you have to click on a link from an e-mail
sent by certificates.amazon.com. E-Mail subject will be `Certificate approval for <example.org>`.

If you did the challenge successfully, you can now check the status of
your certificate. Find the ARN of the new certificate:

        aws acm list-certificates

Describe the certificate and check the Status value:

        aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:<snip> | jq '.["Certificate"]["Status"]'

If this is no "ISSUED", your certificate is not valid and you have to fix it.
To resend the CSR validation e-mail, you can use

        aws acm resend-validation-email


=== Install components kube-aws-ingress-controller and skipper

Kube-aws-ingress-controller will be deployed as deployment with 1
replica, which is ok for production, because it's only configuring
ALBs.

        REGION=${AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES#*,}
        REGION=${REGION:0:-1}
        sed -i "s/<REGION>/$REGION/" templates/kube-aws-ingress-controller-deployment.yaml
        kubectl create -f templates/kube-aws-ingress-controller-deployment.yaml

Skipper will be deployed as daemonset:

        kubectl create -f templates/skipper-ingress-daemonset.yaml

Check, if the installation was successful:

        kops validate cluster

If not and you are sure all steps before were done, please check the logs of the POD, which is not in running state:

        kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l component=ingress
        kubectl -n kube-system logs <podname>

=== Base features

Deploy one sample application and change the hostname depending on
your route53 domain and ACM certificate:

        kubectl create -f templates/sample-app-v1.yaml
        kubectl create -f templates/sample-svc-v1.yaml
        sed -i "s/<HOSTNAME>/demo-app.example.org/" templates/sample-ing-v1.yaml
        kubectl create -f templates/sample-ing-v1.yaml

Check if your deployment was successful:

        kubectl get pods,svc -l application=demo

To check if your Ingress created an ALB check the `ADDRESS` column:

        kubectl get ing -l application=demo -o wide
        NAME           HOSTS                          ADDRESS                                                              PORTS     AGE
        demo-app-v1   myapp.example.org   example-lb-19tamgwi3atjf-1066321195.us-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80        1m

If it is provisioned you can check with curl, http to https redirect is created automatically by Skipper:

        curl -L -H"Host: myapp.example.org" example-lb-19tamgwi3atjf-1066321195.us-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
        <body style='color: green; background-color: white;'><h1>Hello!</h1>

Check if kops dns-controller created a DNS record:

        curl -L myapp.example.org
        <body style='color: green; background-color: white;'><h1>Hello!</h1>

=== Advanced Features

We assume you have all components running that were applied in `Base features`.

Deploy a second ingress with a feature toggle and rate limit to protect you backend:

        sed -i "s/<HOSTNAME>/demo-app.example.org/" templates/sample-ing-v2.yaml
        kubectl create -f templates/sample-ing-v2.yaml

Deploy a second sample application:

        kubectl create -f templates/sample-app-v2.yaml
        kubectl create -f templates/sample-svc-v2.yaml

Now, you can test the feature toggle to access the new v2 application:

        curl "https://myapp.example.org/?version=v2"
        <body style='color: white; background-color: green;'><h1>Hello AWS!</h1>

If you run this more often, you can easily trigger the rate limit to stop proxying your call to the backend:

        for i in {0..9}; do curl -v "https://myapp.example.org/?version=v2"; done

You should see output similar to:

        *   Trying 52.222.161.4...
        -------- a lot of TLS output --------
        > GET /?version=v2 HTTP/1.1
        > Host: myapp.example.org
        > User-Agent: curl/7.49.0
        > Accept: */*
        >
        < HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
        < Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
        < Server: Skipper
        < X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
        < X-Rate-Limit: 60
        < Date: Mon, 27 Nov 2017 18:19:26 GMT
        < Content-Length: 18
        <
        Too Many Requests
        * Connection #0 to host myapp.example.org left intact

Your endpoint is now protected.

Next we will show traffic switching.
Deploy an ingress with traffic switching 80% traffic goes to v1 and
20% to v2. Change the hostname depending on your route53 domain and
ACM certificate as before:

        sed -i "s/<HOSTNAME>/demo-app.example.org/" templates/sample-ing-tf.yaml
        kubectl create -f templates/sample-ing-traffic.yaml

Remove old ingress which will interfere with the new created one:

        kubectl delete -f templates/sample-ing-v1.yaml
        kubectl delete -f templates/sample-ing-v2.yaml

Check deployments and services (both should be 2)

        kubectl get pods,svc -l application=demo

To check if your Ingress has an ALB check the `ADDRESS` column:

        kubectl get ing -l application=demo -o wide
        NAME           HOSTS                          ADDRESS                                                              PORTS     AGE
        demo-traffic-switching   myapp.example.org   example-lb-19tamgwi3atjf-1066321195.us-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80        1m

If it is provisioned you can check with curl, http to https redirect is created automatically by Skipper:

        curl -L -H"Host: myapp.example.org" example-lb-19tamgwi3atjf-1066321195.us-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
        <body style='color: green; background-color: white;'><h1>Hello!</h1>

Check if kops dns-controller created a DNS record:

        curl -L myapp.example.org
        <body style='color: green; background-color: white;'><h1>Hello!</h1>

You can now open your browser at
link:https://myapp.example.org/[https://myapp.example.org] depending
on your `hostname` and reload it maybe 5 times to see switching from
white background to green background. If you modify the
`zalando.org/backend-weights` annotation you can control the chance
that you will hit the v1 or the v2 application. Use kubectl annotate to change this:

        $ kubectl annotate ingress demo-traffic-switching zalando.org/backend-weights='{"demo-app-v1": 20, "demo-app-v2": 80}'


=== Cleanup

        for f in templates/sample*; do kubectl delete -f $f; done
        kubectl delete -f templates/skipper-ingress-daemonset.yaml
        kubectl delete -f templates/kube-aws-ingress-controller-deployment.yaml


You are now ready to continue on with the workshop!
